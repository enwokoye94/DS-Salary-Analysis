An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

methods to assess the impact of the assimilated environmental observations on
the subsequent analysis and forecasts.
She/he will develop algorithms to summarize and display the results for
system users. Additionally, she/he will employ advanced numerical and machine
learning techniques to facilitate rapid and comprehensive characterization of
the impact of the new observations on the forecast, and identify areas for
improvement in the underyling data assimilation system or in the algorithms
used to pre-process the observations.

This position requires the ability to conduct and assist
in leading-edge research on the development and application of state-of-the-art
methodologies for atmospheric data assimilation and forecasting systems and to
use these methodologies to develop next generation probabilistic prediction

Machine Learning Scientist – Data Team,90-146 ,"Come join our team, and together we’ll realize the true potential of gene therapy!

Who we are

Dyno Therapeutics is a Cambridge based, VC-backed biotech startup that uses next-gen DNA technologies and machine learning to engineer Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) capsids for the effective delivery of gene therapies.

What we offer you

As a member of our quickly growing company, you’ll help us shape Dyno into a startup that takes its scientific mission seriously and provides a positive and supportive workplace environment. Dyno will have the opportunity to benefit from your insight, skills, and talent while enriching your professional and scientific experience as we grow the company together.

Our mission

At Dyno, we are expanding the boundaries of gene therapy. AAV capsids are currently the vector of choice for gene therapy, but they are only a starting point in the gene therapy revolution. Dyno aims to dramatically extend the reach of gene therapy by overcoming the limitations of existing AAV capsids, allowing more therapies to reach the clinic. Doing so will enable treatment for millions of patients with currently incurable, often disabling and deadly diseases.

How?

Dyno’s groundbreaking engineering pipeline harnesses advances in DNA library synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning to generate transformative gene therapy vectors. We target the major barriers that separate AAV gene therapy research from real-world therapies, including delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type specificity, immune evasion, and more. Our vectors will accelerate the transition of gene therapies from the lab to the clinic for the benefit of patients worldwide.

Where?

Dyno is located near Kendall Square in Cambridge. Situated within the dynamic LabCentral community, Dyno is working alongside other startups that are also creating the future of biomedicine.

General role

The data science team is at the heart of Dyno’s platform, and your work as a part of this team will have a potentially major impact on the future of gene therapy. The team's responsibilities span biological data analysis, machine learning model building, computational optimization, and experimental design of high-throughput viral libraries. Opportunities to apply rigorous theoretical approaches from combinatorial optimization, bayesian optimization, bandit strategies, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and compressive sensing in our platform abound. The successful candidate will have expertise in one of these (or related) topics and would like to apply them to a new domain. The field of capsid engineering is ripe with problems that are interesting from a learning perspective, and Dyno is well-placed to generate data at a scale at which these approaches can be fruitful.

As an early member of our team, you will have the opportunity to help craft our approach, shape our culture, and positively impact people’s lives. You will work closely with a group of talented, driven, and fun scientists. We are located in Lab Central in a dynamic community of biotech startups. The guideline below should give you a rough picture of who we are looking for, but depending on your background, you may bring different qualities to our team. Don't hesitate to write to us if you think you are a good fit. We offer competitive benefits.

Basic qualifications

BS, MS, or Ph.D. in a quantitative field (Machine learning, Math, Physics, CS, Operations Research, Statistics, ...) or equivalent experience.
Strong theoretical foundation in machine learning or a related domain.
Expertise in one or more general-purpose programming languages (such as Python or C/C++.)

At Signifyd we're creating a new market. We're constantly improving and expanding the technology that has changed what fraud protection for ecommerce looks like. So we don't have time for office politics. We understand that different people have different work styles and we thrive on variety while learning from each other. We're all Signifyers, so we know that what needs to get done will get done.

Signifyd is a place where no one is going to tell you how to do your job. If you want help, you'll get it — from all quarters. But we pretty much figure out what needs to be done, who's in the best position to do it and then let that person roll-up her or his sleeves and have at it. We're protecting retailers from online fraud in a way that's never been done before and we could use your help if you're someone:
Who believes challenges are best overcome by thinking differently.
Who knows his or her role, but isn't confined by it.
Whose greatest satisfaction comes from helping customers succeed and achieve their dreams.
Who isn't afraid to disagree, convincingly, civilly and honestly.
The Data Science team at Signifyd builds the models that power our fraud detection engine. We make fraud prevention at scale possible. Our machine learning pipeline keeps us one step ahead of fraudsters and their constantly evolving tactics and our research and experiments develop into new products that improve the merchant payments experience.

We expect our data scientists to be hands-on. We carry solutions from a brainstorm to experimentation and all the way to deployment. Some days you may spend doing research and designing experiments while others are spent using your analytical toolbox to surface insights into real-time fraud attacks. We're a varied group with a diversity of strengths -- some team members came to us from academic backgrounds, others from engineering, some from big companies and some from small, but all of us are curious and collaborative.

How you'll have an impact:
Building production machine learning models that identify fraud
Designing new algorithms that optimize all the key components of the Signifyd Commerce Protection Platform
Writing production and offline analytical code in Python and Java
Researching real-time emerging fraud patterns with the Risk Analysis team
Working with distributed data pipelines
Communicating complex ideas effectively to a variety of audiences
Collaborating with engineering teams to continuously strengthen our machine learning pipeline
Mentoring other members of the team
Past experience you'll need:
An advanced degree (M.S. or Ph.D) in computer science, applied mathematics, or a comparable analytical field
At least 2-3 years of experience post M.S. required
Hands-on statistical analysis with a solid fundamental understanding
Designing experiments and collecting data
Writing code and reviewing others' in a shared codebase, preferably in Python and Java
